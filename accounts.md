# Create Accounts!

A couple of things to help us along:

1. **Use your first name as part of your username wherever possible**
2. **Open links in new tabs.** GitHub repos have a lot of links. We recommend right-clicking (or holding the command key (mac) / control key (win) when clicking) to open links in new tabs.
3. **Skim read context: sections.** We use Context: to indicate the information is useful but not essential for completing the task right now.

## Accounts you need

1. GitHub
2. Slack


## GitHub
GitHub is how the curriculum is delivered and will be where you keep all of your code from EDA. It can also be a type of technical resume when applying for positions, so make sure your user name sends the right message. 

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2. Choose a username that:
    - includes your first name
    - is something you'll be happy for employers to see
    - Is snake-case (all lowercase letters with words separated by hyphens, e.g. bobs-yer-uncle).
3. Add photo and name in [account settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) 
4. Check your email and click the validation link


## Slack
The Enspiral Dev Academy Slack community is where most of our communications take place. 

__Please use the EDA naming convention:__ 
firstname_firstLetterOfLastName_cohort e.g. anahera_p_kakapo.

1. Join our Slack Workspace using this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/eda-staff/shared_invite/enQtNDI3NzA5NTcxMzQ2LTdmYmNhYjI1MmUxMjVlYjhjY2QxYWM3ZjU4ODAwMjU5MGRhMmEyZjY0MDM3MzJlZWNhMDM3ZTk2MGZlODNhZmY) 
2. Respond to the verification email (check spam if you can't see it) and follow instructions 
4. Download the [Slack desktop app](https://slack.com/app)
5. Use the desktop app to sign into the _enspiral-dev-academy_ workspace. 
6. Add a picture of your self (drop down at the top left of the app, under 'profile and account')

#### Slack Channels 
When you join up, you will be automatically added to our core channels. However you will need to search for a few more. 

Here are a list and breif description of the core channels you need to join. 

__Click the word `channels' from within the app to reveal available channels.__  


1. **Your cohort-specific channel** E.g. #Nikau: Used for cohort communication. For example, finding a partner to pair with, problem solving, and checkin coordination.
2. **#code-helpdesk**: If you can't get help on a problem in your cohort channel, come here next! Read by grads, teachers, and friendly developers.
3. **#general**: stuff everyone in the EDA community should know about. For example, events, announcements, congratulating people.
4. **#show-eda**: stuff you're working on that you'd like to share. New open source projects, games, pretty things. One of your final assignments in Phase 0 requires you to use this channel.
5. Either **#auckland** or **#wellington**: site-specific news, meetups, "I'm locked out", "Who owns the car that's parked me in?" etc.
6. **#random-stuff**: web development jokes, cat GIFs, xkcd.


## Slack Guidelines

We recommend that anytime you are working on the material you have the [Slack app](https://slack.com/downloads) open.

To see who is in the channel, click the 'i' icon in the top right corner. If you have a specific question for someone you can direct message them, but keep in mind that others in the community might know the answer too, so don't cut yourself off from the pool of community knowledge by posting unnecessary private messages.

You can tag someone in your post by putting an @ in front of their user name. If they are not online, they will be notified via email. If you want the whole group to know something, you can use @channel. This will send an email to everyone in the channel. Nonetheless *refrain from using @channel for channels that are not the cohort channel*.
