# Yellow flags
We gauge a student's fit in Foundations and Dev Academy through their kindness, integrity, and effort that they put into the program. Participation and communication are key components. Students who demonstrate any or a combination of the indicators below may be put on a path for monitoring or being asked to leave. These indicators, or yellow flags include, but are not limited to:

- Leaving challenges unattempted
- Not following the submission procedure
- Copying code on solo challenges
- Demonstrating apathy for their pair or the challenge
- Missing scheduled meetings
- Having difficulty engaging with a pair
- Lacking the ability to demonstrate the learning outcomes
- Failing to submit feedback
- Failing to stay in touch with EDA staff, or respond to calls, emails, and Slack messages


### Getting asked to leave
It's not our goal to kick people out of the program. It _is_ our goal to identify people who will not thrive at Dev Academy. We take the decision to ask a student to leave seriously, and we do so after considerable thought. Having one yellow flag emerge during the course of Foundations is NOT a deal-breaker in and of itself, but showing a combination or repeatedly demonstrating any of these indicators is a problem.
