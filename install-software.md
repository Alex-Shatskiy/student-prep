# Install software

At EDA you'll be using specific tools every day: a terminal, an editor and Git (which you'll install in week 1). You'll also need a web browser of course, and for consistency we suggest you use Google Chrome. We'll be installing the following:

1. __A command Line Tool:__ iTerm2 (Mac) or Babun (Windows)  
2. __A code/text editor:__ Visual Studio Code  

__Note about Visual Studio Code:__ Visual Studio Code, or VS for short, is a text editor. Developers write code locally their computer via a text editor, before pushing it up onto the web. Other popular text editors include Sublime and Atom. 

## OS X (Mac) 

__Command Line Tool: *iTerm*__  
Mac's come with an inbuilt command line called 'terminal', however iTerm2 is our terminal of choice. 


1. Navigate to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)  
2. Download and install it  


__Text Editor: *VS Code*__

1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip, and drag the app into your applications folder


## Windows instructions
The Windows development environment can be a little tricky to set up correctly, mostly because of the lack of a good terminal. One option is to dual-boot Linux, a way of installing a development setup without sacrificing your current operating system. There are some good guides available to set this up. However it's probably not something you want to try first if you're just starting out and not feeling very confident.

__Command Line Tool: *Babun*__  
Babun is quite a similar way of working to the Mac and Linux terminals, and will allow you to follow most of Foundations without installing other software.

1. Go to [Babun](https://babun.GitHub.io)
2. Follow the download and install instructions

__Text Editor: *VS Code*__

1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip and intstall it in your programs directory

## Linux instructions (Ubuntu)

__Command Line Tool: *GNOME*__  
Already installed with Ubuntu!

1. Open up GNOME Terminal
2. Have a looksie

__Text Editor: *VS Code*__
1. Navigate to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install the current stable release
3. Unzip and intstall
