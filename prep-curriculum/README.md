# Prep Curriculum

The prep curriculum is designed to help you get a headstart. It is recommended, but optional. 

At Dev Academy we factor into our curriculum our understanding of research and methodologies that improve the effectiveness of education. It is unlike traditional learning and understanding its uniqueness will actually help you to learn faster. For example, within the fileds of neuroplaticity and education research shows that learners, introduced to concepts of how their brain works (e.g. the formation of new neural networks) actually learn faster. 

So in this prep curriculum we want to introduce you to the benefits of crafting a learning-practice and learning-insight to help you solve problems and take in new information more effectively. 

This is an extraordinary undertaking and requires some rethinking about what we know about ourselves and education and what we do in practice. 

The second part of the prep curriclum introduces you to the tools and recommended resources to start programming.
