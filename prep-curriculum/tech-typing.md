# Typing and Shortcuts

Don't underestimate the importance of your typing skills! It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

- Take a baseline [test](http://www.typingtest.com/index.html) to see how fast you currently type.
- To learn the basics in touch typing and to improve your speeds, try either [typingstudy](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) or [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html).
- If you are already an accomplished touch typist, try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols.
- Knowing some common VS Code shortcuts will help you save a lot of time while coding. Take a look at [these common shortcuts](https://medium.com/@kvinklly/top-short-code-keys-for-vscode-95ecffe71560) or see if you can find your own recommendations online. You can see the full list of commands on the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_basic-editing).

You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
 - Use common shortcuts (eg. find text, toggle a comment, copy a line)
